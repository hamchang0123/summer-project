```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# I. Download the dataset
## 0. Setup

```{r}
pacman::p_load(XML, RCurl, tidyverse, rio, stringr)
```

## 1. Create a url
Example url from the guide document:
http://openapi.data.go.kr/openapi/service/rest/Covid19/getCovid19GenAgeCaseInfJson?serviceKey=인증키(URL Encode)&pageNo=1&numOfRows=10&startCreateDt=20200310&endCreateDt=20200414

```{r}
## Setting up the elements for url
api <- "http://openapi.data.go.kr/openapi/service/rest/Covid19/getCovid19GenAgeCaseInfJson"
key <- "TaxRxVR8AqgXSmn034eCgeXLEU%2FZx01iBlO6gs3tKVeSdEr2v3W2WPWzN%2Bhf2Z%2BgIU99%2B1b7LCIgR0WsosPfWQ%3D%3D"
  # available from the user page
page_no <- 1
num_rows <- 10
start_date <- 20211101
end_date <- 20220331

## Creating the url
url <- paste(api, 
             "?serviceKey=", key,
             "&pageNo=", page_no,
             "&numOfRows=", num_rows,
             "&startCreateDt=", start_date,
             "&endCreateDt=", end_date,
             sep="")
```
paste(): concatenate using separation factor
- sep="": without a space
- sep=" ": with a space; default

paste0(): append using separation factor
- equivalent to paste(sep="")

## 2. Download the dataset

```{r}
## Download the xml document 
xmlFile <- xmlParse(url)

## Convert the xml document to a dataframe
df <- xmlToDataFrame(getNodeSet(xmlFile, "//items/item"))
```
xmlParse(): XML 또는 HTML 파일에 대해 R에서 인식하는 구조로 변환해주는 함수

## 3. Process the dataset part 1

The original dataset (df) contains incidence by age and sex. As sex is not relevant data in this project, a dataset for age-specific incidence will be created.

```{r}
## Create a dataset for age-specific incidence
df_age <- df %>%
  filter(gubun != "남성" & gubun != "여성") %>%
    # filter only the rows of which the gubun column is not "남성" and not "여성"
  mutate(age = recode(gubun, "80 이상" = "80+"))
    # create a column called age, which is the replication of gubun, of which "80 이상" is recoded as "80+"

## Select relevant columns
df_age2 <- df_age %>%
  select(-updateDt, -gubun, -seq)
```

Currently, the date column, createDt, has too much information. Only the year-month-date are needed. 

As createDt is a string of which the date part (what we want) and time part are separated by a space, we will separate the string and only select the part we want.

```{r}
## Split createDt & remove createDt
df_age2 <- df_age2 %>%
  mutate(date = str_split(createDt, " ", simplify=TRUE)[, 1])%>%
  # [, 1] selects the first column of the character matrix (1x2)
  select(-createDt)

## Reorder columns
colorder <- c('date', 'age', 'confCase', 'confCaseRate', 'death', 'deathRate', 'criticalRate')
  # the order of column as desired

df_age2 <- df_age2[, colorder]
```

str_split(string, pattern, n = Inf, simplify = FALSE)
- simplify = FALSE: returns a 'list' of character vectors
- simplify = TRUE: returns a character matrix

## 4. Process the dataset part 2

Currently, age groups are 10-yr bands. We would like to merge age groups into either children (0-19) or adults (20+). 

Including 19 year-olds as children is not only inevitable due to the inherent nature of the dataset but also sensible as they are still high schoolers.

Another important step here is changing the type of variables as they are all strings now. To allow summary statistics, they shall be rendered to appropriate formats.

```{r}
## Create age groups: children (0-19), adults (20+)
df_age3 <- df_age2 %>%
  mutate(agegroup = recode(age, 
                           "0-9" = "children", "10-19" = "children",
                           "20-29" = "adults", "30-39" = "adults", 
                           "40-49" = "adults", "50-59" = "adults", 
                           "60-69" = "adults", "70-79" = "adults",
                           "80+" = "adults"))

## Change data types of variables 
df_age3 <- df_age3 %>% 
  mutate(case = as.numeric(confCase), 
         case_rate = as.numeric(confCaseRate),
         death = as.numeric(death), 
         death_rate = as.numeric(deathRate),
         critical_rate = as.numeric(criticalRate),
         date = as.Date(date))%>%
  select(-c(confCase, confCaseRate, deathRate, criticalRate))

## Reorder columns
colorder2 <- c('date', 'age', 'agegroup', 'case', 'case_rate', 'death', 'death_rate', 'critical_rate')

df_age3 <- df_age3[, colorder2]
```

Currently, the dataset is unorderly. To allow case incidence by age and date, the data should be grouped by agegroup and then by date.  

```{r}
## Group by children or adults
df_grp <- df_age3 %>%
  group_by(agegroup, date) %>%
  summarise(case = sum(case),
            .groups = 'drop')
  #case incidence in adults and children and by date

## Reorder columns
colorder3 <- c('date', 'case', 'agegroup')
df_grp2 <- df_grp[, colorder3]
  
df_grp_all <- df_grp %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_case= sum(case),
            .groups = 'drop')
#total population case incidence by date


```

```{r}
case_1125 <- df_grp_all%>%
  filter(date=='2021-11-25')%>%
  select(total_case)
  #429002

case_0330 <- df_grp_all%>%
  filter(date=='2022-03-30')%>%
  select(total_case)
  #12774956
  
increment <- case_0330 / case_1125
  #about 30 times 
```
